### Description

No vote is needed :)

The original code was submitted by Vlad a long time ago, I just added extra feature to support office 2003 menu. Unfortunately I was able to download Vlad's submission and made some modification to it, but when I was about to upload my modification I found out that Gary Noble (Phantom Man) has already made a submission in year 2003 that actually support 2003 menu, but I manage to incorporate some of the functionality of Gary's submission to this and made some minor modification.

sorry for my first upload, I didn't remove the other components
